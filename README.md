This is the admin mode for the app "BTG_MATRIX". It allows a sommelier or restaurant manager to add, edit, and delete wines on the wine list. Due to previous issues deploying it full stack this portion of the app was split into 2 parts, a front end and a back end, but since have merged back into one, in this repo.

Demo https://github.com/jbcastro/btg_user_mode This app is usually "sleeping" so please give it some time to load.

Previous repos for the app when it was split.
